## **⚠️ Antivirus Warning**

Because this script:

    uses commands like shutdown, tasklist, net user,

    can execute other .exe programs,

    accesses network and system settings,

some antivirus or Windows Defender software may falsely flag it as suspicious.

    🧠 Don't worry – the script is 100% safe. The full source code will be made publicly available in the future.

To avoid issues:

    Add the folder or file to your antivirus exclusion list (optional)

    Right-click → Run as Administrator if required for some features (e.g., user management)
