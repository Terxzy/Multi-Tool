⚠️ Antivirus Warning

Because this script:

    uses commands like shutdown, tasklist, net user,

    can execute other .exe programs,

    accesses network and system settings,

some antivirus or Windows Defender software may falsely flag it as suspicious.

    🧠 Don't worry – the script is 100% safe and open-source.
    You can open and review the .bat file in any text editor before running it.

To avoid issues:

    Add the folder or file to your antivirus exclusion list (optional)

    Right-click → Run as Administrator if required for some features (e.g., user management)
